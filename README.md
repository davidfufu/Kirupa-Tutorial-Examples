# Kirupa-Tutorial-Examples

Ok, this is supposed to be used in conjunction with Kirupa's React guide.
https://www.kirupa.com/react/index.htm
I find it to be the best and most well written guide on beginner React concepts so far.
It tries to explain things in detail, without making things overly complicated.

One shortcoming is that it's a bit outdated with how it creates components, and uses React Router, which has already gone to version 4.

Below are my rewrites of tutorial code into more up to date React best-practices.

Installation:
1. Have node installed. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Have npm installed. https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
3. Have git installed. https://git-scm.com/downloads

4. clone this repository into a folder, ex. "Kirupa Tutorials"
5. open up the console and cd into the "react-hotload-template" folder.
6. run "npm install" in the console in the above mentioned folder
7. staying in the same folder, run "npm run dev"
8. you should see results in browser


9. Relevant files are "index.js" in the /react-hotload-template/src folder. and index.html in the /react-hotload-template folder.
10. The first tutorial is in the index.js file. If you want see the other tutorial files, first close the console that is running the local host, go into Tutorial Exercise Files, pick a folder, and copy the index.js file there. Replace the index.js file in react-hotload-template/src/index.js with the one you copied and run "npm run dev" in the console. Make sure you're in the react-hotload-template folder when you run the command.
